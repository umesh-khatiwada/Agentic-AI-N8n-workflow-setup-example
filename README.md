## 🐳 Docker Compose Deployments

### Basic Setup with PostgreSQL
The most common setup for production use with a PostgreSQL database backend.

**Location**: `docker-compose/withPostgres/`

**Features**:
- PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- Environment-based configuration
- Production-ready setup

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd docker-compose/withPostgres/
# Edit .env file with your credentials
docker-compose up -d
```

### Scaled Setup with Worker
For high-volume workflows, includes a separate worker container for better performance.

**Location**: `docker-compose/withPostgresAndWorker/`

**Features**:
- PostgreSQL database
- Separate worker container for processing
- Better performance for heavy workloads

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd docker-compose/withPostgresAndWorker/
# Edit .env file with your credentials
docker-compose up -d
```

### Subfolder with SSL
Deploy n8n on a subfolder with SSL support, useful for existing web infrastructure.

**Location**: `docker-compose/subfolderWithSSL/`

**Features**:
- SSL/TLS support
- Subfolder deployment
- Reverse proxy configuration

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd docker-compose/subfolderWithSSL/
# Edit .env file with your credentials
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🌐 Caddy Reverse Proxy Setup

**Location**: `docker-caddy/`

A complete setup using Caddy as a reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS certificates.

**Features**:
- Automatic SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Easy domain configuration
- Production-ready reverse proxy

**Supported Platforms**:
- DigitalOcean
- Hetzner Cloud

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

**Location**: `kubernetes/`

Complete Kubernetes manifests for deploying n8n in a Kubernetes cluster.

**Features**:
- Scalable deployment
- Persistent volume claims
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Service definitions

**Supported Cloud Providers**:
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Azure (Microsoft Azure)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Resources Included**:
- n8n deployment and service
- PostgreSQL deployment and service
- Persistent volume claims
- ConfigMaps and secrets

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
All Docker Compose setups use `.env` files for configuration. Key variables include:

```env
# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_DB=n8n
POSTGRES_USER=n8n
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# n8n Configuration
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

### Security Considerations
⚠️ **Important**: Always change default passwords before deployment!

- Update database credentials in `.env` files
- Set strong passwords for n8n authentication
- Configure SSL/TLS for production deployments
- Review network security settings

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n workflows

**Note**: n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, consider [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).
