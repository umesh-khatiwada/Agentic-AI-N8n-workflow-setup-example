## Prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

* Setting up and configuring servers and containers
* Managing application resources and scaling
* Securing servers and applications
* Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).
